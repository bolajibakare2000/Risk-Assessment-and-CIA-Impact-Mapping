# Risk Assessment and CIA Impact Mapping

This repository introduces **risk assessment and CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) impact mapping**, a structured way to evaluate how threats affect critical assets across the CIA triad. It is intended for security and risk practitioners who want a practical starting point for rating risks, mapping them to CIA impacts, and prioritizing mitigation actions.
